This is a Chrome Extension that works with Salesforce.com. Now updated to work with lightning!

If you are on a Salesforce.com record page, that is a page where the Salesforce.com
URL conatins a record Id, click the scissors icon once to clip the Id to your
clipboard. Clip it again and you'll get the 18 character verison of the id. Click
again to get a cleaned version of the URL in the address bar. The icon turns green
when you successfully clip the Id, and shows an 18 when you get the 18 character version 
and 'Link' when you get the link.

You may also right click any link to a Salesforce.com record URL on any webpage
and do two actions:

1. Clip the Id (15 or 18 characters), just as you would from a record page

2. Get a clean record URL, dropping any parameters after the Id, like search
position

Now works with VF pages with an id on the querystring, and User profile pages.
