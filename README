This is a Chrome extension that works with Salesforce.com.

If you are on a Salesforce.com record page, that is a page where the Salesforce.com
URL conatins a record Id, you can click the scissors icon to clip the Id to your
clipboard. Clip it again and you'll get the 18 character verison of the id. The icon
turns green when you successfully clip the Id, and shows an 18 when you get the 18
character version (thanks to Jeff Douglas for the code!)

You may also right click any link to a Salesforce.com record URL on any webpage
and do two actions:

1. Clip the Id (15 or 18 characters), just as you would from a record page

2. Get a clean record URL, dropping any parameters after the Id, like search
position

Now works with VF pages with an id on the querystring. Thanks to boxfoot for the
contributions!
